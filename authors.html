<h1>Information for Authors</h1>

<h3>Call for Papers</h3>

<p>
  Here is the <a href="cfp.html">Call for Papers</a>.
</p>

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>1. General Information</h3>


<p>
  Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference/workshop. Every paper accepted at CNSM 2022
  <!-- <a href="registration.html"> -->

must have an associated registration at the Author rate.  At least one
author of each accepted paper must be registered for the
conference/workshop <!-- by October 16th 2022 --> in order for that paper to
appear in the proceedings and to be scheduled for presentation. For a
paper in which all authors are students, one student author must
register at the Author rate. For authors presenting multiple papers,
one author registration is valid for three papers at most.
</p>

<h3>2. Paper Submission</h3>

been published or submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers should
be prepared using the IEEE 2-column conference style and are limited
to 9 pages including references (<i>full papers</i>) or 5 pages including
references (<i>short papers</i>).

<p>Papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through
  <a target="_" href="https://www.edas.info/newPaper.php?c=29457">EDAS</a>
<!--  , with direct links for:

<!--  Please note that IEEE has recently updated the LaTeX template and only the new template will be accepted.-->
</p>


<p>
Papers exceeding page limits, multiple submissions, and
self-plagiarized papers will be rejected without further review. All
other papers will get a thorough single-blind review process, followed
by a rebuttal phase.

<h1> Guidelines for Accepted  Papers </h1>

<a name="formatting"></a>
<h3>1. Formatting and IEEE Xplore Compliance</h3>

<p>
  When your accepted paper (full paper, mini-conference paper, short
  paper, workshop paper) is presented, it will appear soon afterwards
  on IEEE Xplore® (the IEEE Digital Library) and it is important that
  your submitted PDF file meets the
  <a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">specification for IEEE Xplore</a>
</p>

<h4>1.1 Page Limit</h4>

<p>The page limits, where all paper lengths must include the references,  are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CNSM full papers: 9 pages (<i>including references</i>);</li>
  <li>CNSM mini-conference papers: 7 pages (<i>including references</i>)</li>
  <li>CNSM short papers: 5 pages (<i>including references</i>);</li>
  <li>Workshop full papers: 7 pages (<i>including references</i>);</li>
</ul>

<p>Please address the suggestions raised by the reviewers to improve the quality of your paper and make sure to comply with all formatting requirements. Please note that it is not possible to purchase extra pages.</p>

<h4>1.2 Templates</h4>

<p>
  Please format your final submission using the guidelines provided in&nbsp;
  <a href="http://www.ieeelcn.org/IEEE_conf_layout.pdf">IEEE_conf_layout.pdf</a>
  . The guidelines are implemented in IEEE templates. LaTex authors please verify you are using the following documentclass:
  <br>
  <br>
  <code> \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} </code>
  <br>
  <br>

  Only in case you are unable to use LaTex, other text processors may be used at your own risk. IEEE provides a template for Word in US-Letter size. Your final submission must follow all IEEE conference formatting requirements (
  <em>e.g.</em>
  , font sizes, margins, and layout). Thus, check them really carefully.
</p>

<h3>2. Paper Upload</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Before uploading your paper, please:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Check that title and abstract in EDAS match your camera-ready paper exactly</li>
  <li>
    Please use Title Case for the paper title,&nbsp;
    <em>i.e.</em>
    &nbsp;capitalizing all main words
  </li>
  <li>Compare all author names in EDAS with the author list in your paper. They must be identical and in the same order</li>
  <li>Enter all middle names/initials you prefer to use in the paper in the author profile EDAS, as well</li>
  <li>Ensure that special characters in the paper match the EDAS entry. EDAS supports UTF-8 special characters, such as Ã¤Ã¯Ã¶Ã¼ÃŸÃ®Ã§Ã±Ã©, etc. for author names</li>
  <li>Have the PDF checked or created by IEEE PDFXpress; upload the certified file returned from IEEE PDFXpress into EDAS</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This is very important because we will be using the information provided in EDAS to generate the final conference program and the table of contents for IEEE Xplore. Please note that the abstract and title should be readable stand-alone and not contain any references or unexplained acronyms. 
</p>

<strong>Copyright Notice</strong>

<p>The Publication Chairs will add the copyright notice to your paper.<!-- as follows: --></p>

<!-- 
<ul>
  <li>For papers in which all authors are employed by the US government, the copyright notice is: U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright</li>
  <li>For papers in which all authors are employed by a Crown government (UK, Canada, and Australia), the copyright notice is:  <span class="cn-blue">978-3-903176-31-7 &copy; 2022 Crown</span></li>
  <li>For all other papers the copyright notice is:  <span class="cn-blue">978-3-903176-31-7 &copy; 2022 IFIP</span></li>
</ul>
-->

<p>
  In case you need to modify the title or the abstract, you can do this through EDAS. Changes to the list of authors, allowed only under exceptional circumstances, have to be approved by TPC chairs. All the camera-ready papers have to be submitted via EDAS <!-- before <strong class="cn-blue">October 16th, 2022</strong> -->. </p>


<strong>PDF Express</strong>

<p>
  Use <a href="https://ieee-pdf-express.org/account/login">IEEE PDF eXpress</a> to check Xplore-compatibility, the CNSM 2022 account uses as the conference ID: <em>55787X</em>
</p>

<p>  EDAS will prevent you from uploading papers that do not comply with formatting checks. Please check all requirements carefully again if that happens. If you believe your paper is compliant and you are still prevented from uploading, please send your PDF eXpress™-certified PDF file to the publication chair and ask for advice. Please always put your EDAS paper number in the subject line of email communication.
</p>



<strong>IFIP Copyright Form</strong>

<p>Authors of CNSM, <!-- AnServApp or IPFuture workshops --> are required to transfer the copyright of their accepted papers to IFIP.</p>

 <p>In this case you have to upload the IFIP form. First, click <a href="files/ifip-copyright.pdf">here</a> to get the IFIP copyright form. Read and fill it up adequately. Don’t forget to include the title of your work, the first and last names of all the authors, and then sign it. After getting the copyright ready, log onto EDAS and click on the copyright logo (&copy;) of your accepted CNSM or Workshop paper. Update the signed copyright, following instructions on EDAS. Once you finish that process, EDAS will show the type and date of copyright submission on your paper page.
</p>

 <strong>Metadata for ACM Digital Library</strong>
 
<p>Authors are required to submit metadata from their accepted paper(s) in order to speed up the process of generating the proceedings and registering them in the ACM library. Please complete the Google form available at <a href="https://forms.gle/9gefSS42DKyp4HgV9">https://forms.gle/9gefSS42DKyp4HgV9</a> and upload in EDAS the receipt (copy in PDF) of the answers provided to Google.</p>
