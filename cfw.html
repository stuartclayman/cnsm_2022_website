          <h1>Call for Workshops</h1>

          <p>
            This year our Workshop Co-Chairs are
            Barbara Martini, CNIT, Italy
            and
            Augusto José Venâncio Neto, Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.
            They will be looking for more interesting tutorials for this year's CNSM.
          </p>

          <p>
CNSM 2021 invites proposals for one-day workshops, which will be held
on Monday, 25 October 2021, or Friday, 29 October 2021. The main purpose of the
CNSM 2021 Workshops is to provide a forum for researchers, developers,
operators, integrators, standards experts, and user communities to
address and discuss timely topics related to the main conference.
