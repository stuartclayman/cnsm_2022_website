      <p>The 18th International Conference on Network and Service Management (CNSM) is inviting authors to submit original contributions in network and service management research. CNSM 2022 is a selective single-track conference, covering all aspects of the management of networks and services, pervasive systems, enterprises, and cloud computing environments. CNSM 2022 is technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Communications Society, IFIP, and ACMâ€™s in-Cooperation support.</p>

      <p>CNSM 2022 will focus on the theme "Intelligent  Management of Disruptive Network Technologies and Services". The core track will be accompanied by a series of workshop and poster sessions.</p>

      <h2>COVID-19 Notice</h2>
      <p>
        The Organizing Committee of CNSM 2022 believes that a physical-presence event is the most appropriate form for a scientific conference. Thus, we hope to welcome all CNSM attendees to Thessaloniki in October and we expect significant in-person attendance.  At the same time, we are well aware that the Covid pandemic is far from being overcome. We understand that not everyone may be able or willing to travel given the circumstances. CNSM will therefore also accommodate remote participants and presenters.</p>
