<h1>Instructions for Presentations</h1>

<p>CNSM 2022 will be held as a hybrid conference where remote speakers will present their work using Zoom and the Whova event platform. We require all speakers to give their talk live in their allotted time slot.</p>

<p>However, to cope with possible connectivity issues, <em>each remote presenter is also required to record and submit a video of her/his talk by October 23, 2022.</em></p>

<p>Only in the event of technical or connectivity issues that prevent the speaker from presenting live, the pre-recorded video of the presentation might be played, but the Presenter has to take all means to present his/her talk live. In any case, at least one of the paper’s authors must be online for the live Q&A. If not, the paper will be flagged as “a no-show” and will not be published in IEEE Xplore.</p>

<p>Each remote presenter will receive an email from Whova, the conference management tool, with a link to an online form to submit their video, fill in their bio, and complete their profile. In-person speakers are not required to submit a video.</p>

<p><em>Please see Whova platform Instructions under</em> <a href="instructions-for-online-participation.html">Instructions for Online Participation.</a></p>

<p>Note that the presenter data should be consistent with the paper-related info uploaded in EDAS. The speaker must be a co-author of the paper and must be registered to the conference. A registered author who wants to delegate the presentation to a co-author loses access to the conference platform. If both the registered author and the presenter want to access the platform and conference material, the presenter should register at the participant rate.</p>


<p>Below are the maximum durations of video recording per paper/session type:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full Paper presentation video: <em>25</em> min</li>
  <li>Mini-Conference Paper presentation video: <em>15</em> min</li>

<h2>Instructions for Video Recording</h2>

<p>Videos should contain a prominent view of the presentation slides along with audio of the spoken presentation. Optionally, videos may contain a shot of the speaker’s head for increased engagement. (This shot should be thumbnail-sized and overlayed on the slide images as shown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8JV3w4TOVw">here</a>). Many presentation applications support integrated audio and video recording, in appropriate video format.
