<h2 id="key1" class="cn-blue" style="clear: both; padding-top: 0.5em;">Self-adjusting networks: vision, solutions, challenges</h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Stefan Schmid, Technical University of Berlin, Germany</h3>

<p>Communication networks are a critical infrastructure of our digital society, and data traffic is currently growing explosively, especially to, from, and inside datacenters. However, today's manual and error-prone approach to manage and operate communication networks stands in stark contrast to the increasingly stringent dependability and performance requirements. In this talk, I will present the vision of more automated and "self-driving" communication networks. We will learn about the enabling technologies for such networks as well as first solutions presented in the literature. To make things more concrete, I will give two examples of this vision: First, I will discuss the design of networks which automatically verify, repair and "synthesize" themselves, to ensure policy compliance at any time. Second, I will show how emerging optical communication technologies enable self-adjusting networks which optimize themselves towards the workload they currently serve, in a demand-aware manner, and which can hence significantly improve network throughput. We will conclude by discussing open challenges and avenues for future research.

<h2 id="key2" class="cn-blue"  style="clear: both; padding-top: 2em;">Management Challenges for Delivering 6G-powered Applications and Services </h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Panagiotis Demestichas, University of Piraeus / WINGS ICT Solutions, Greece</h3>

<p>Wireless is an essential component for transforming diverse verticals, enterprise and consumer applications. This a trend that was set at the center of attention in 5G. Similar approaches will be intensified in 6G. Advanced 6G powered applications and features will be enabled, such as massive twinning, cooperative robots, XR, and all other technologies necessary for progressing to the tight coupling of the physical, biological and digital worlds. These aspects call for advances in the management of the infrastructures. Known and novel functionalities will be needed in the management of spectrum / communication resources, the cloud continuum, storage aspects. More stringent non-functional requirements will need to eb achieved in the management, in terms of decision making delay, robustness, security and compliance with legal / ethical frameworks. The talk will revisit all these aspects: vertical needs, management challenges, novel functional and non-functional requirements for the management.

<h2 id="key3" class="cn-blue" style="clear: both; padding-top: 2em;">From Digital Transformation to Socio-Digital Innovation </h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Dimitra Simeonidou, University of Bristol, UK </h3>

<p>5G was primarily developed with a focus on industry, addressing the importance of advanced connectivity and IoT to drive digital transformation in vertical sectors. 6G needs to take a more holistic approach towards people and economy, focusing on global societal challenges such as climate change, inclusion, poverty, skills, the future of work and civic renewal. This talk will introduce the notion of adopting Cyber-Physical-Social System (CPSS) approaches to the design of the next generation mobile networks. This is an emerging concept addressing the need to understand the impact of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) on society and vice versa, and design digital infrastructures accordingly. It reflects on projected trends of 6G, its users and their environment. The talk will further explain the rational for human-centric service models and will justify the need to leverage on human intelligence and co-creational methodologies in the design and delivery of future mobile networks.

<h2 id="key4" class="cn-blue" style="clear: both; padding-top: 2em;">Automated and secure lifecycle management for IoT </h2>

<h3 class="cnsm-header">Antonio Skarmeta, University of Murcia, Spain </h3>

<p>The recent and well-known attacks and vulnerabilities that IoT have been suffering, underline the need for automated approaches to the deployment of IoT devices in order to design a framework for the detection, analysis, and mitigation of cybersecurity attacks in IoT deployment. Indeed, the scale and heterogeneity of IoT devices require self-configuration mechanisms without human interaction to reduce the attack surface. Due to the huge interconnectivity of such scenarios, a vulnerability in a single device could have catastrophic consequences in the whole network. This is further accentuated by the deployment of technologies such as 5G, where the large number of relationships and interdependencies between the components of the architecture harden security management. The next generation of IoT devices should be able to self-manage their own security, being able to adapt to environmental conditions and to react to possible attacks. In order to set the basis for this evolution, we propose a cyclical methodology integrating and instantiating the different processes necessary to achieve the self-management of the device within their lifecycle management.
