<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>6G research has just started around the globe and it becomes obvious, that 6G is supposed to become an agile and organic network environment able to adapt dynamically to dedicated needs, KPIs and changing situations. Thus management aspects have to be considered already in the early phases of architectural design of 6G. This tutorial is structured into four parts.</p>

<p>First the tutorial provides a motivation for 6G and and a short overview of global 6G initiatives. Subsequently the tutorial will provide an overview on the technological and operational trends, which is believed to affect the upcoming 6G infrastructure. This includes higher frequencies communications (sub-THz, THz and optic) enabling enhanced communications, positioning, and sensing as well as satellite and Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) integration with 5G and 6G for coverage extensions, extra capacity and global, cross-country coverage. Also we address the evolution of network softwarization towards cloud-native network architectures pushing enabling DevOps and CD/CI mentalities for agile network provisioning as well as RAN function virtualization, disaggregation driven by Open RAN stimulating the RAN-Core convergence. All this will lead to a core network evolution towards an organic end-to-end 6G data driven architecture, dynamically adapting to the momentary service requirements and infrastructure resources available based on AI/ML. We will compare these trends with the current 5G campus networks evolution, as we assume that this will be the nucleus for a successful 6G adoption.</p>

<p>In part three will outline a potential end-to-end 6G architecture and emerging management aspects we will outline a first high level organic 6G architecture and the related management issues to be addressed. Based on the previous review of the state of the art in research and evolution trends the tutorial will concentrate in this part on the 5G core network evolution towards 6G and its integration with different fronthaul and backhaul networks. This is done by adopting newer software development paradigms, such as web services, micro-services, distributed data bases and shared memory systems, but also perform a re-consideration of mobility, QoS, authentication, authorization and access control functionality in the new 6G context underlining the progress which has to be achieved until 6G. On the management side the importance of properly granular system monitoring, data acquisition, data curation and data exchanges as fundamental technologies for extensive system automation is considered key enabling a redefinition of the network management paradigm to consider the advancements on complex system theory, intent based systems, and the potential support of machine learning for defining subscription profiles and ultra-customized networks.</p>

<p>Finally, we provide examples, how researchers could setup their own 6G research infrastructure based on current open 5G testbed infrastructures. The globally recognized Open5GCore toolkit (www.open5GCore.org) will be used as an example on how 6G research could be enabled by existing open networking toolkits and how hands-on practical implementations enable to pin-point potential developments, underline potential technologies (see also www.6g-ready.org). An outline of the German BMBF Open 6G Hub (www.open6ghub.de) will be given at the end of the tutorial.</p>

<h4>Abstract </h4>

<p>Next Generation (NextG) communications and computing systems present competitive environments, where the users evolve in a physical, digital, or virtual space with others, sharing the same resources. These systems are characterized by partial system information availability, uncertainty of system available resources, and risks in the decisions/actions taken by the users. In such emerging distributed and competitive networking environments, it is imperative to design resource management processes, that reconcile the user and system goals, and conclude to mutually beneficial points. In this tutorial, we aim to introduce the audience to resource management paradigms, that address and treat these challenges. Towards this direction three main distinct models are reviewed and presented to treat the problems of information incompleteness (Contract Theory), risk-aware resource management with uncertainties (Prospect Theory and Tragedy of the Commons), and distributed resource management design (non-cooperative Game Theory). The scope of this tutorial is, first, to provide an introduction to the basic principles and models of each theory independently, and then, emphasize on how these theories can work complementary to address the resource allocation problem in NextG wireless communications and computing systems that implement several disruptive network technologies and services, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted communications, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB), and multi-layer delay-tolerant computing.  The application of the aforementioned theories in the common real-life problems of bandwidth sharing in wireless networks and computing resource sharing in Edge Computing systems, concludes the tutorial. </p>


<p>The tutorial specializes in the management of future wireless networks and edge/cloud computing deployments and services with respect to the radio and computing resources that are utilized and shared among the end-users. The specific challenges introduced by the adoption of disruptive technologies (e.g., Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted communications, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB), multi-layer delay-tolerant computing) are analyzed, and the application of economic models and solutions is presented, towards dealing with the general problems of bandwidth and computing resource sharing.</p>

<h4>Abstract</h4>

<p>As per the trend, 5G and beyond 5G networks are going to be increasingly softwarized, virtualized, cloudified and edgified. The reason being such networks allow efficient monitoring and management, provide resiliency and self-configurability, facilitate agile creation of vertical services, and offer flexible level of services and many more advantages. Nevertheless, softwarization of future wireless networks will also increase the potential for security breaches, date privacy vulnerabilities, malicious access control, illicit utilization of resources, installation of unauthentic virtual network functions. We posit the potential of distributed ledger technology (DLT) technologies, including Blockchain, in addressing some of these challenges, partly due to the underpinning decentralized and consensus-driven DLT technologies and the combination of cryptographic processes. Despite recent advances in DLT/blockchain, there remain many challenges when we attempt to integrate the use of DLT/blockchain in 5G and beyond 5G supported systems, for example in terms of scalability, privacy issues, and performance. Therefore, this tutorial will focus on key aspects of blockchain/DLT technologies in 5G and beyond 5G  applications, and in particular, solicit and present state-of-the-art advances and use cases in various aspects relating to the design and implementation of blockchain/DLT technologies in 5G and beyond 5G  applications. Moreover, it will provide a demonstration of how to deploy Blockchain in B5G use cases.</p>


<p>For a long-time blockchain, the most famous DLT has been looked at as an isolated technology. However,  blockchain and other DLTs are being integrated with other technologies such as IoT, Big Data, and Artificial Intelligence. This trend fuel the adaptation of DLTs for the Realization of Beyond 5G Networks and its services.  Blockchain and other DLTs are identified as a technology that could solve a number of technical challenges beyond 5G Networks. So, Let’s have a look at the role of Blockchain and other DLTs in beyond 5G Networks!</p>
