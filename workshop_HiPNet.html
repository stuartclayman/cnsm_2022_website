<h3>Workshop Description</h3>

<p>
For the past 50 years, traffic delivery across the Internet is based on the “Best Effort” paradigm, whose characteristics only improved through faster underlying physical networks, lower average load, but the ongoing need to reduce congestion based latency, which often is called buffer-bloat. In controlled networks, the 25 year old architectures for Differentiated and Integrated Services are still the only widely adopted or attempted solution, but today, new waves of networked applications continue to push the limits of these technologies. Augmented Reality and Tactile Internet require ultra-low latency measured in single-digit milliseconds. Requirements of Industrial Internet applications that involve real-time industrial control are even more stringent and tolerate no jitter at all. Even consumer entertainment such as cloud gaming requires ever lower latencies with higher throughputs and mastered jitter. Indeed, economic pressures mandate increasing cloudification of real-time applications with precision service level needs. Compounding this situation is the fact that many of those applications are mission-critical and cannot afford any loss in connectivity or even single packets. Collectively, these applications require high-precision also called predictable networks that are characterized by very stringent service level boundaries and associated guarantees that border on determinism.
</p>

<p>
Various approaches are emerging that will allow to tackle those challenges. Data centers with fixed topologies and a constant number of hops rapidly replace conventional routing and more general Internet topologies. Networks are becoming more programmable to custom-tailor and optimize the treatment of packets and flows. Related technologies range from Service Function Chaining to Network Slicing to SDN. While 5G is making URLLC at the network edge a reality, momentum for mobile networks beyond 5G are beginning to push the boundaries of precision services beyond the edge and across the network core. Simultaneously, the last decade has seen significant improvements in the industry’s ability to build flexible packet forwarding planes at high speed with programmable packet treatments, allowing to overcome many prior technology constraints that made better technologies prohibitive in the past. Intelligent control interfaces and ultra-low latency control loops can optimize service levels,  and high-precision measurements and telemetry with nanosecond accuracy at scale can act as enablers for those more intelligent control-loops and better management planes. 
</p>

<p>
The workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers, students and professionals from industry and academia to discuss challenges and present work-in-progress and solution approaches in support of delivering, managing, controlling, monitoring or measuring network traffic with high-precision in networks ranging in speeds and scale from Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) all the way to multi-Tbps Wide-Area Internet core networks, including Data-Center and 5G/6G mobile networks with (Ultra) Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (URLLC), predictable, available, or deterministic services. The workshop welcomes papers related to disruptive concepts, innovative solutions, testbeds, experiments, etc.

      <h4 class="cn-blue">Extensible In-band Processing (EIP) for High Precision Networking</h4>
      <p><i>Keynote speaker</i>: Stefano Salsano</p>

      <p><i>Abstract</i>: Extensible In-band Processing (EIP) is a solution to extend the IPv6 networking layer. IPv6 hosts and can cooperate by reading and writing the EIP information in the IPv6 packet headers, to support a number of use cases, like for example advanced monitoring, semantic routing, slicing. In this talk we will present the EIP motivations, its architectural design and its open source prototype implementation and we will discuss its application to High Precision Networking.</p>

      <h4 class="cn-blue"> A High Precision Communication Platform for Linux via XDP/QDisc</h4>

      <p>Speaker: Mohit P. Tahiliani</p>

      <p><i>Abstract</i>: High Precision Communication (HPC) and reliability in Industrial
Systems are essential for the Industry 4.0 applications. Lack of open
source platforms present challenges in validation and verification of
new algorithms developed for the IIoT applications. We developed a
Linux based test platform that supports high-precision communications
as an in-network capability. The platform is developed on Linux and
allows users to rapidly develop, deploy and test different in-network
directives. In this talk, we will present the implementation of
latency-based forwarder directive using Linux based forwarding and
scheduling techniques. We will discuss our experiences in the
development of this platform with a focus on eXpress Data Path (XDP)
and queuing disciplines.</p>
